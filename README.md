# Update:
See latest PR.

# Purpose of this repository:
The purpose of this repository is to create a custom MARL
(multi-agent reinforcement learning) environment where multiple agents trade
against one another in a CDA (continuous double auction).

The environment doesn't use any external data. Data is generated by self-play
of the agents themselves through their interaction with the limit order book.

At each time step, the environment emits the top k rows of the aggregated
order book as observations to the agents. Each agent then samples an action from
the action space & all actions are randomly shuffled before execution in each
time step.

Each time step is a snapshot of the limit order book & a key assumption is that
all traders(agents) suffer the same lag (wait for all traders to have their orders
executed before seeing the next LOB snapshot).

---

# Example:
The example is available in this Jupyter notebook implemented with
RLlib: `CDA_NSP.ipynb`. This notebook is tested in Colab.

This example uses two trained agents & N random agents. All agents compete with
one another in this zero-sum environment, irregardless of whether they're
trained or random.

**competitive self-play**

The policy weights of the winning trained agent(trader) is used to replace the
policy weights of the other trained agents after each training iteration.
Winning here is defined as having the highest reward per training iteration.

The reward function requires the agents to maximize profit while minimizing
number of trades made in an episode (trading session). As the number of trades
accumulates in the later stages of a session, profits will be scaled down by
the number of trades & losses will be magnified.

The trained agents are P0 & P1, both using separate PPO policy weights. The
rest are random agents.

The results with 10 agents are shown in the figures below:

If you're running locally, you can run the following command & navigate
to ```localhost:6006``` in your browser to access the **tensorboard graphs**:
```
$ tensorboard --logdir ~/ray_results
```

---

**Other ways** to run this environment:

By using the python `CDA_env_rand.py` script which is basically running a
CDA simulator with dummy (non-learning) random agents.

# Dependencies:

1) tensorFlow
2) ray[rllib]
3) pandas
4) sortedcontainers
5) sklearn

For a full list of dependencies & versions, see `requirements.txt` in this
repository.

---

# Installation:
The environment is installable via pip.
```
$ cd gym-continuousDoubleAuction

$ pip install -e .
```

---

# TODO:

1) Better documentation.

2) Generalize the environment to use more than 1 LOB.

3) Parametric or hybrid action space (or experiment with different types of
action space).

4) Expose the limit orders (that are currently in the LOB or aggregated LOB)
which belongs to a particular trader as observation to that trader.  

5) Allow traders to have random starting capital.

6) Instead of traders(agents) having the same lag, introduce zero lag
(Each LOB snapshot in each t-step is visible to all traders) or random lag.

7) Allows a distribution of previous winning policies to be selected for
trained agents. (training)

8) Custom RLlib workflow to include custom RND + PPO policies. (training)

9) Update current model (deprecated) or use default from RLlib. (training)

10) Move TODO to issues.

# Appendix:

---

# Observation space:

Each obs is a snapshot in each environment step.

```
obs = [array([1026., 2883., 1258., 1263., 3392., 1300., 1950., 1894., 2401., 4241.],          # bid size list
       array([64., 63., 62., 61., 60., 59., 58., 57., 56., 55.]),                             # bid price list
       array([ -519., -2108.,  -215., -1094., -1687., -2667., -3440., -2902., -1440 -3078.]), # ask size list
       array([-65., -66., -67., -68., -69., -70., -71., -72., -73., -74.])]                   # ask price list
```

---

# Action space:

See [PR 9](https://github.com/ChuaCheowHuan/gym-continuousDoubleAuction/pull/9) for the current action space.

---

# Reward:

If `NAV_chg` is used as the reward. The `episode_reward` from RLlib training
output will be 0, indicating a zero-sum game.

```
NAV_chg = float(trader.acc.nav - trader.acc.prev_nav)

# maximize NAV
#rewards[trader.ID] = NAV_chg
```

However, if the `NAV_chg` is scaled, then the `episode_reward` from RLlib
training output will NOT be 0.

```
# maximize NAV, minimize num of trades (more trades gets penalized).
if NAV_chg >= 0:
    rewards[trader.ID] = NAV_chg / (trader.acc.num_trades + 1)
else:
    rewards[trader.ID] = NAV_chg * (trader.acc.num_trades + 1)

trader.acc.reward = rewards[trader.ID]
```
